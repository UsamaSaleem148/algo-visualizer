# Insertion Sort Visualization

This project provides an interactive visualization of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm. It helps users understand how the algorithm works by visually displaying the sorting process step-by-step.

## üñºÔ∏è Features

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch how the elements of the array are sorted in real-time.
- **Colorful Animations**: Elements are highlighted when being compared or swapped.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adapts to various screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create the sorting animation. Here's how it works:

1. **Array Initialization**: The array elements are displayed as colored blocks.
2. **Sorting Process**: The **Insertion Sort** algorithm is executed, and the current element being sorted is highlighted. When elements are compared or swapped, they are visually represented.
3. **UI Updates**: The current element being sorted is displayed, and the array is updated dynamically.

## üé® Styling

The page features a vibrant **gradient background** and a **colorful array container**. The array elements change color based on their state (active, comparing, or sorted).
